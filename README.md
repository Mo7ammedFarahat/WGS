<h1 align="center" id="title">Post WGS Analysis</h1>

<p id="description">This script mainly for Post WGS and Variant Calling. In that project we had 200 out of 259 samples used in WGS. The Variant Caller performed including 1000 Genome Project db and gnomADe db. We have used PolyPhen and SIFT scores to determine the clinical significance of our SNPs in addition to retrieve more info about SNPs using ClinVar APIs. Finally we merged the phenotypes with genotypes and filtered that against our genes of interest (ACE1 and ACE2). Check the RScript</p>
